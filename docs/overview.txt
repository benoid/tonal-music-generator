    * mdp-state.rkt
       Authors: Brian Chiang and David Benoit
       Description: Provide a representation of Markovian
                    states and state spaces.  Create and print
                    an example state space.
       Individual Contributions:
         - Brian
             state representation
             part range representation
             collaborated on state space population
             collaborated on state space printing
         - David
             pitch representation
             part range example
             enumerate part range
             find valid pitches for a part range 
               given a harmony
             collaborated on state space population
             collaborated on state space printing

             Checkpoint 2 Update:
               states store info about sequential voicings
               state comparison functions for use in policy search tree
               example state creation

             Final Update:
               states no longer store info about sequential voicings, 
                 as the state space was too big to hold in memory
               commented out state comparison functions for use in 
                 policy search tree

    * mdp-policy.rkt
       Authors: Brian Chiang and David Benoit
       Description: Provide a representation of a Markovian
                    policy. We ended reworking our algorithm,
                    and this particular is no longer used.

    * racket-avl-modified.rkt
        Author: Jan Dvořák
        Description: A modified version of the main.rkt file from racket-avl
        Changes made by David Benoit as part of the AI project: 
          Added lines 386-406, which are a modified version of 
          the avl-contains? function called avl-find.  avl-find
          returns the match of the item in the tree, or #f if not found.

## Project Dependencies
  Composer library
    Author: David Benoit
    Description: A library which provides a music theory abstraction
                 to Racket's RSound Library.  This library was written partially
                 alongside our AI Final Project, and partially beforehand.
                 It is not intended to be graded as content in the project.
 
                 It is being written as part of David's fork of RSound, 
                 which is the main repository for the code.  It is 
                 available here:
